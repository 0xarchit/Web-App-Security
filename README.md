> # Testing methodologies on Web Applications

The key categories of web application testing include:


## 1. Static Application Security Testing (SAST):

- This approach is referred to as "white-box" testing.
- We examine the source code directly without executing it.
- It is particularly effective for identifying vulnerabilities such as SQL injection patterns, hardcoded credentials, and buffer overflows at early stages of development.
- Consider it as a code review facilitated by security-focused automated tools.



## 2. Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST):

- This method is known as "black-box" testing.
- We assess the application in its operational state, similar to an attackerâ€™s perspective.
- Tools generate malicious input and analyze the responses.
- This approach is especially effective for detecting runtime issues such as XSS, CSRF, and authentication vulnerabilities.



## 3. Interactive Application Security Testing (IAST):

- This combines elements from both SAST and DAST.
- The application is instrumented to observe behavior in real-time.
- This provides improved accuracy with fewer false positives.
- It can also uncover vulnerabilities within third-party components.


To ensure a structured testing approach, we use following methods:

### 1. Reconnaissance

- Mapping the application's architecture.
- Identifying potential entry points.
- Understanding the underlying technology stack.

### 2. Information Gathering

- Enumerating all endpoints.
- Identifying relevant parameters.
- Analyzing observed response patterns.

### 3. Vulnerability Assessment

- Testing the validation of input fields.
- Evaluating the effectiveness of authentication mechanisms.
- Assessing session management practices.
- Reviewing business logic vulnerabilities.

### 4. Exploitation

- Confirming the existence of identified vulnerabilities.
- Assessing potential impact.
- Documenting the attack vectors and chains.

### 5. Reporting

- Documenting all findings comprehensively.
- Evaluating associated risk levels.
- Offering actionable remediation recommendations.

An effective testing methodology integrates both automated and manual testing techniques.
Tools such as Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP, and Acunetix are mostly used, but they cannot substitute for human intuition and creativity in identifying logical flaws.

> # What is DevSecOps?

DevSecOps integrates security practices throughout the entire software development lifecycle, rather than treating it as a final step. It combines development, security, and operations into a unified, automated process.
Key components of DevSecOps:

- Automated security testing in CI/CD pipelines
- Infrastructure as Code with built-in security controls
- Continuous vulnerability scanning and monitoring
- Security policy enforcement through code
- Shared security responsibility across teams

Tools commonly include:

- SAST/DAST scanners
- Container security platforms
- Secret management systems
- Compliance automation tools
- Security monitoring solutions

The goal is making security automated, scalable, and integrated into development workflows rather than being a bottleneck or afterthought.

> # Various SAST and DAST Tools & Differences between them

## SAST Tools:
- SonarQube: Code quality + security analysis, supports multiple languages
- Checkmarx: Enterprise-level scanning, deep code analysis
- Fortify: Comprehensive vulnerability detection, high accuracy
- Brakeman: Ruby-specific, fast scanning
- ESLint (security plugins): JavaScript focused, lightweight

## DAST Tools:
- Burp Suite: Industry standard, extensive features
- OWASP ZAP: Free, automated scanning
- Acunetix: Advanced web vulnerability scanning
- Netsparker: Proof-based scanning, low false positives
- Qualys: Cloud-based scanning, compliance focused

## Key Differences:

| Aspect | SAST | DAST |
|--------|------|------|
| Testing Method | Analyzes source code without execution | Tests running applications |
| Perspective | Inside-out (white box) | Outside-in (black box) |
| Stage | Early development | Testing/Production |
| Findings | Code-level vulnerabilities | Runtime/deployment issues |
| Speed | Faster, immediate feedback | Slower, more thorough |
